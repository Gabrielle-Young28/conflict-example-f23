hello conflicts, DO not fear them!!!!

This is content that was defintely added through the GitHub interface. I am causing a merge conflict.

Thid sentefnce was added no where. 

This is a repo that is used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge things when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it can and requires humans to end the world. 


i feel like crap.
